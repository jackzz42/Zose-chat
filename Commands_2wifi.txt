Yes, MAC address randomization is already included in the script, but it only runs once when you start the script.

To make it fully automatic, we need to ensure it changes every few minutes. Here's how to do it:


---

ðŸ”¹ 1. Make MAC Address Change Automatically Every 5 Minutes

Modify your script to include this command, which creates a cron job:

(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * macchanger -r wlan0") | crontab -

This will automatically change the MAC address every 5 minutes.


---

ðŸ”¹ 2. (Optional) Change MAC Every Time WiFi Disconnects

To make it even more secure, we can change the MAC every time the WiFi disconnects.

1. Edit the network manager dispatcher script:

nano /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-macchanger


2. Add this code:

#!/bin/bash
if [ "$2" = "down" ]; then
    macchanger -r wlan0
fi


3. Save and exit (CTRL + X, then Y, then ENTER).


4. Give it execution permissions:

chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-macchanger



Now, your MAC address automatically changes when WiFi disconnects.


---

ðŸ”¹ 3. Verify That MAC Address is Changing

Run this command to check your current MAC address:

ip link show wlan0 | grep ether

Run it before and after 5 minutes to see the change.


---

âœ… Now, your MAC address will keep changing automatically!

This makes it much harder for hackers, ISPs, or tracking systems to follow your device.
